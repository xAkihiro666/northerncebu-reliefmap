# 🗺️ Admin Map Access Guide

## Overview

Admins can now access the public map with special delete privileges. When you click "View Map" from the admin panel, you'll be taken to the public map where you can delete pins directly while viewing them on the map.

## 🔐 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
1. Admin logs into admin.html
   ↓
2. Firebase Authentication creates session
   ↓
3. Admin clicks "View Map" button
   ↓
4. Opens index.html (public map)
   ↓
5. Map detects admin session via Firebase Auth
   ↓
6. Admin sees delete buttons on all pins
   ↓
7. Public users see "Only admins can remove locations"
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Admins

1. **Always verify before deleting**
   - Read pin details carefully
   - Check if relief has been delivered
   - Confirm it's spam/duplicate

2. **Use map view for visual context**
   - See pin locations geographically
   - Identify clusters of reports
   - Spot duplicate nearby pins

3. **Keep session active**
   - Don't logout unnecessarily
   - Session persists across tabs
   - Can switch between admin panel and map

4. **Document deletions**
   - Note why you deleted a pin
   - Keep track of spam patterns
   - Report systematic issues

### For System Administrators

1. **Monitor admin activity**
   - Check Firebase Authentication logs
   - Review deletion patterns
   - Watch for unusual activity

2. **Secure credentials**
   - Change default password
   - Use strong passwords
   - Don't share admin access

3. **Regular backups**
   - Export Firestore data regularly
   - Keep backup of deleted pins
   - Document major cleanups
