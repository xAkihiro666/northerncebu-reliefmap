# ✅ "Mark as Reached" Feature - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What Was Added

Regular admin users can now **mark locations as reached** instead of deleting them. Only the master admin (charleszoiyana@gmail.com) can delete pins.

---

## 🔐 Access Levels

### **Master Admin (charleszoiyana@gmail.com)**
- ✅ View Details button (👁️)
- ✅ **Delete button (🗑️)** - Can delete pins
- ❌ No checkbox (doesn't need it)

### **Regular Admin Users (Signed up accounts)**
- ✅ View Details button (👁️)
- ✅ **Checkbox** - Mark as Reached
- ❌ No delete button

---

## 📋 How It Works

### For Regular Admin Users:

1. **Login** to admin panel (`admin.html`)
2. **See the table** with all pins
3. **Each pin has**:
   - 👁️ View Details button
   - ☑️ Checkbox to mark as reached

4. **Check the box** to mark location as reached
5. **Location is marked**:
   - ✅ Green "Reached" badge appears
   - Row gets light green background
   - Checkbox shows "Reached"
   - Timestamp saved

6. **Uncheck the box** to mark as not reached
   - Badge disappears
   - Normal background returns

### For Master Admin:

1. **Login** to admin panel
2. **See the table** with all pins
3. **Each pin has**:
   - 👁️ View Details button
   - 🗑️ Delete button (no checkbox)

4. **Can delete** any pin permanently

## 💾 Data Stored

When a location is marked as reached:

```javascript
{
  reached: true,
  reachedAt: "2025-10-03T12:45:00.000Z",
  reachedBy: "user@example.com"
}
```

When unmarked:

```javascript
{
  reached: false,
  reachedAt: null,
  reachedBy: null
}
```

## 🔧 Firestore Rules Update

**IMPORTANT**: Update your Firestore security rules to allow regular users to update the `reached` field:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Relief locations collection
    match /relief-locations/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if true;
      
      // Only master admin can delete
      allow delete: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.token.email == 'charleszoiyana@gmail.com';
      
      // Authenticated users can update reached status
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && (
                      // Allow updating reached, reachedAt, reachedBy fields
                      request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                        .hasOnly(['reached', 'reachedAt', 'reachedBy'])
                      ||
                      // Master admin can update anything
                      request.auth.token.email == 'charleszoiyana@gmail.com'
                    );
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow delete: if false;
    }
  }
}
```
