# 👥 User Sign-Up System - Complete Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

I've added a user sign-up and login system for regular users who can view and add pins but **cannot delete** them.

   - Confirm Password
4. **Click "Create Account"**

### For Logged-In Users

When logged in, the map shows:

## 📊 User Data Storage

When a user signs up, their info is stored in Firestore:

```javascript
users/{userId}/
  - name: "User Full Name"
  - email: "user@example.com"
  - role: "user"
  - canDelete: false  // Cannot delete pins
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - uid: "firebase-user-id"
```

Master admin has:
```javascript
  - role: "master-admin"
  - canDelete: true
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Navigation Bar (index.html)

**Before:**
```
[Public User] [Admin Panel]
```

**After (Not Logged In):**
```
[Public User] [Sign Up] [Login] [Admin]
```

**After (Logged In):**
```
[John Doe] [Logout] [Admin]
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Email already in use"
**Solution**: User already has an account. Use "Login" instead.

### "Invalid credentials"
**Solution**: Check email and password are correct.

### "Email/password sign-up not enabled"
**Solution**: Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Enable Email/Password
3. Save

### User can't see delete button
**This is correct!** Only master admin can delete pins.
